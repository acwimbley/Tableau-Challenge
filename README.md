Background
The data used for this project was for the months of January and June for the years 2019 and 2020.  This is during the time of the pandemic. 
The data sets were reviewed to see if the number of columns/names were the same.  Later data sets did not maintain all the data elements from the previous year.  
Some of the takeaways from the data were:
•	Was a significant drop in the number of subscribers or customers renting bikes during the selected months of the pandemic?
•	What generation were most likely to be heavy users of the rental bikes?
•	Which start and end stations saw an increase or decrease of bike rentals/returns?
•	Which gender typically rented bikes? 
•	What was the average age of the subscribers/customers?
•	What is the most popular date for bikes to be rented?
•	Which bikeid was highly used?
Two maps were included in the visualization.  One for the start stations and another for end stations.  Filters were also included in the dashboard for the month and year, gender, and usertype
The one story illustrated the Generation grouped which was a calculated field using the birth year for the age and grouping into the generation category.

Some Analysis of the data
•	Data supports that there remains an increase between the months of January and June. This may be contributed to warmer temps in June. It appeared that the pandemic did impact as shown by the counts between the two years.
•	Data supports that Millennials and GenXs represent the majority of those users to support the program.  More study is needed to see if the younger generations will increase in years to come and/or participate.  Again, other factors are needed.  
•	The BikeID by distance and trip duration shows which bikes are long lasting, which bikes were added within the year and which bikes were retired.
•	The Start Station showed that Perishing Square North was the popular Start Station for January, June 2019, and January 2020. However, in June 2020 12th Avenue &W 40th Street Start Station was popular. Further investigation needs to be done to analyze the reason.
•	The Start Station and End Station maps can be filtered by user type and the month/year to see which areas were heavily used.  The map is overlayed with zip codes and popular sites.
•	The most popular day of the week by trip duration for Customers were Saturday and Sunday.  This may indicate that these are tourists.  The most popular day by the number of users for Subscribers was Wednesday but not for trip duration.   
•	The bottom end stations would need further analysis to determine if they are worth maintaining. What type of users are going to these stations? If these are in residential areas, then consideration of the frequency of use may need to be investigated.

Conclusion
This is just the beginning of learning how to visualize the data.  One of the challenges was in trying to plot points from the start station and end station.  This could be due to the person starting and ending at the same station or the stations were in too much proximity. 
I had some help from the tutor, instructor and teaching assistant in answering questions and looking up information regarding setting up a start and end points to calculate distance.
